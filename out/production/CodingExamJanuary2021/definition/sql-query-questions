Please read the questions and answer.

What is Database?
Ans:- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored
electronically in a computer system.

What is DBMS?
Ans:- Database Management Systems (DBMS) refer to the technology solution used to optimize and manage
the storage and retrieval of data from databases.

What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
Ans:- SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database.
You can use SQL to access, update, and manipulate the data stored in a database.
MySQL is a database that stores the existing data in a database in an organized manner.

What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
Ans:-A relational database management system is a common type of database that stores data in tables,
so it can be used in relation to other stored datasets.
The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a
tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files.

What are Tables and Fields?
Ans:- A table has records (rows) and fields (columns).
Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks.

What is SQL?
Ans:- SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What are Constraints in SQL?
Ans:- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit
the type of data that can go into a table. ... Constraints can be column level or table level. Column
level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

What is a Primary Key?
Ans:- The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain
UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

What is a Foreign Key?
Ans:-The Foreign Key constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A Foreign Key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY
in another table.

What is Normalization?
Ans:- Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable
characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.

What is Denormalization?
Ans:- Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more
tables. This can help us avoid costly joins in a relational database.
