Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans:- Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large
databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient
algorithms.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans:- Various operations can be performed on different data structures such as creation,insertion,deletion,
searching,sorting,traversing,merging,appending & updating.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:- Data structures are used in any program or software.
      They are used in the areas of.
      Compiler Design.
      DBMS.
      Graphics.
      Simulation.
      Numerical Analysis.
      Artificial Intelligence.

what is an Array?
Ans:- An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans:- An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.
Therefore array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and
modify them. Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not.

what is LinkedList?
Ans:- Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java. util package.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans:- An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection
of elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers. Array elements
can be accessed randomly using the array index. Random accessing is not possible in linked lists.

what is queue?
Ans:- Java Queue is an interface available in java. util package and extends java.
what is stack?
Ans:- The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It is based
on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans:- FIFO:- is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where
             the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last.
      LIFO:-is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.

what is the order of complexity?
Ans:-
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans:- If we were searching for the first element, Linear Search would be the most efficient one here.
It's also easy to see the Binary, Interpolation and Fibonacci Search show the best results for this
particular array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans:- The worst-case time complexity is linear. Similarly, searching for an element for an element can
be expensive, since you may need to scan the entire array.

what is tree in data structure?
Ans:- A tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure.

what is graph in data structure?
Ans:- A graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph
concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans:- HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without
proper synchronization code whereas Hashtable is synchronized.HashMap allows one null key and multiple
null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans:-

How HashMap works in java?
Ans:- HashMap in Java works on hashing principles. It is a data structure which allows us to store object
and retrieve it in constant time.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans:- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are
trying to access array element with an illegal index. This exception is thrown when the index is either
negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans:- There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.
      Manually, Arrays.copyOf, System.arraycopy, Object.clone.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans:- An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of
objects known as a node where node consists of two parts data and address. Array elements store in a
contiguous memory location.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans:- BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search. 2. BFS uses Queue data
structure for finding the shortest path. DFS uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
Ans:- Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to
break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans:- linear data structure, data elements are sequentially connected and each element is traversable
through a single run. In non-linear data structure, data elements are hierarchically connected and are
present at various levels.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans:- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when
the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
